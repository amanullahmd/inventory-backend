-- V14: Seed Initial Data
-- DEPRECATED: Dummy data seeding has been removed for production safety.
-- This migration is kept for reference only and does not insert any data.
-- 
-- To seed data in production, use the API endpoints:
-- - POST /api/categories
-- - POST /api/items
-- - POST /api/users (admin only)
--
-- Or use manual database operations with proper validation.

-- No data is inserted by this migration
